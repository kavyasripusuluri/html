        <h2 style = "color:purple"> most legal systems, one becomes a legal adult on a particular birthday
         when they reach the age of majority (usually between 12 and 21),
         and reaching age-specific milestones confers particular rights and responsibilities.
          At certain ages, one may become eligible to leave full-time education,
           become subject to military conscription or to enlist in the military, to consent to sexual intercourse,
            to marry with parental consent, to marry without parental consent, to vote, to run for elected office, 
            to legally purchase (or consume) alcohol and tobacco products, to purchase lottery tickets, or to obtain a driver's licence.
             The age of majority is the age when minors cease to legally be considered children 
             and assume control over their persons, actions, and decisions, thereby terminating the legal control
              and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardians </h2>
